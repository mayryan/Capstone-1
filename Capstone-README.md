# Capstone-1
The purpose of this project is to examine the housing markets in Brooklyn and Queens.  The prices in some neighborhoods have exploded and others rose in more steady manner.  The goal of my project is to be able to idenify a sale by it's price and other factors and to be identify the most important factors to sale price.

A company like Zillow or Trulia may be interested in my work because it may be able to better improve their pricing algorithms.  Prices in New York City can be hard to predict because of location to Subways, type of building and the neighborhood the sale took place in, so any improvement can be critical.
